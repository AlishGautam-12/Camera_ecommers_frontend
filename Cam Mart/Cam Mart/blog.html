                Technology is something that grows and evolves over time and Over the years, technology has
                revolutionized
                our world and daily lives. Society and technology are not two separate things, as they grow alongside
                each
                other. That means large portions of everyday life are being affected by the constant stream of
                innovation
                and advancement in technology, which in turn allows us to have an even better life. Modern technology
                has
                paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. Computers are
                increasingly
                faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. With all of these revolutions, technology
                has also
                made our lives more easier, faster, better, and more fun. But in the past two decades technology has
                grown much
                rapidly like technology has given us smartwatches, tablets, and voice assistant devices and many more.
                nowadays we can do things like transfer money instantly and make purchases for everything from clothes,
                food delivery, groceries,
                furniture, and more. Technology has changed how we entertain ourselves, meet each other, and consume all
                types
                of media. It’s made fun advancements, but it’s also made important advancements in safety when it comes
                to home
                security and medical devices.

            <p class="blog-p">    <!--paragraph-->
                Now, in the middle of a global pandemic, technology has assumed an even greater role in the education of
                our kids.
                At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, over 1.5 billion children across the world were taken out of the
                classroom
                because of school closures, which, in turn, forced the widespread adoption of remote teaching
                technologies and the
                suspension of in-person instruction. There are serious doubts that education will ever return to what it
                was. In a
                recent survey of students and faculty, 83% of students and 89% of faculty believe that the COVID-19
                pandemic will
                have a lasting impact on students in higher education.But one thing’s for sure, whether classrooms are
                set to permanently
                re-open, or whether a more hybrid online/in-person approach will become the new norm, technology will be
                at the center of the educational experience.

            <p class="blog-p">   <!--paragraph-->
                For better or worse, technology affects communication because it is a part of our everyday lives. It
                impacts
                the way we work, entertain ourselves, and stay in touch. You might see the average elementary-aged child
                with
                their head buried in a smartphone and tempted to take a gloomy outlook on what technology has done to
                us. But is it all bad?
                From a business perspective, you could argue that technology communication is beneficial. With this in
                mind, here’s
                a breakdown of everything you need to know about how technology affects communication with customers,
                plus how to use
                these developments to your advantage. On the one hand, technology affects communication by making it
                easier, quicker, and more efficient. It allows you to track
                conversations and therefore provide better customer service. Tech also makes it easier to gather
                customer insights and improve the entire customer experience.
                However, some fear technology affects communication by hindering our ability to build relationships with
                clients and will lead to brands becoming faceless entities.

                Technology has vastly increased productivity, since the ability of computers to solve complex
                mathematical equations has allowed
                them to speed up practically every task. Computer modeling permits engineers to simulate structures,
                vehicles, and materials to
                provide information on performance prior to prototyping. In the office, the ability of networked
                computers to share and manipulate
                data can speed up a variety of tasks – permitting employees to work more efficiently and maximize
                productivity. Technological
                advancements in agriculture have increased food production. In so many areas of our lives, critical
                time-consuming processes can
                now be executed with ease – and in a fraction of the time they once required.
